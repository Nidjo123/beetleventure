# BeetleVenture

A game made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 23 back in 2012 (I was still in highschool!).

## About Ludum Dare
Ludum Dare is a competition where you have 48 hours (a weekend) where you
have to make a complete game from scratch. There is a theme that your game has
to follow.

The theme was **Tiny World**.
